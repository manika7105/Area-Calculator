# Area-Calculator

This is a simple command-line program written in Python that calculates the area of various geometric shapes.  It provides a menu-driven interface for the user to select the shape and input the necessary dimensions.

## Features

* Calculates the area of triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles.
* User-friendly menu for shape selection.
* Input validation (basic - expects numerical input).
* Clear output of calculated area.
* Option to quit the program.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    https://github.com/manika7105/Area-Calculator.git

2.  **Run the program:**
    AreaCalculator.py

3.  **Follow the on-screen instructions:** The program will prompt you to select a shape and enter the required dimensions.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3

## Future Improvements

* More robust input validation (e.g., handling non-numerical input, negative dimensions).
* Add support for other shapes (e.g., trapezoid, parallelogram).
* Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
* Improve error handling.
